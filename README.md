Project Morya is just a collection of bash scripts that runs iteratively to carry out various tools and recon process & store output in an organized way. This Project was built to automate my recon process, and after working on this project for months, I thought to make Project Morya public.

Please feel free to improve it in any way you can. There is no secret involved, and it's just a set of commands and existing tools written in bash-scripts for simple Recon Automation.

Currently this tools supports performing recon for:
 
 1.  Subdomain Enumeration: <br>
      It just enumerate subdomain 
      
 2.  Medium Level Scan: <br>
      It scan's for [ subdomain Enumeration, subdomain Takeover, wayback_Urls, probing_Domains, nuclei_Scanning, port_Scanning ]
      
 3.  Advance level Scan: <br>
      It scan's for [ subdomain Enumeration, subdomain Takeover, wayback_Urls, probing_Domains, nuclei_Scanning, port_Scanning, dirsearch, xss scan ]
